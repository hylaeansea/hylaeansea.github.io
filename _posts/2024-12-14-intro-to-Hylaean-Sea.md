This is an account of my adventure into computable policy, marine conservation, AI alignment, and the 
general idea of an abstract theoric world. The word hylaean is derived from the ancient greek word 
'wood' and typically refers to a wooded area of land. Inspired by the theoric world in Ananthem we are using
it to describe a world of untouched wilderness and beauty. A world of pure creation and life. That is a vision of what the wild sea could look like if we equip ourselves, our policy makers, and our citizens with the tools, the knowledge, and the will to understand it and strive for it.

These first few months will explore concepts of AI Alignment and how these new mathematical and linguistic structures can be used to accelerate us to a world that is more sustainable, equitable, and just. We are focusing on the biological, chemical, and physical aspects of our world's oceans and seas. The purpose of the focus on these ecosystems is two fold:

1. The health of the ocean appears to be a harbinger of the things to come for land based ecologies as well as a bullwark against the destruction of our planet's natural resources and habitats. The worlds oceans are responsible for the uptake of up to 30% of the global CO2 emissions, and up to 90% of the excess heat generated from human activities. The oceans are saving us from ourselves.
2. The worlds oceans are a vast, deep, and challenging mystery and despite heroic and ingenious efforts by conservationalists and scientists, the ocean is still a vast unknown.
