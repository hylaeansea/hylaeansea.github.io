*Image generated with DALL·E; prompt: make a futuristic but realistic image that exemplifies "computable policy" as you have just described*


# Introduction

Many of the incredible advances in AI over the last few years have come as the result of connecting external tools to large language models (LLMs). Tools in the form of:

- [OpenAI Code Interpreter and IDEs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools)
- [LangChain access to APIs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/)
- [Nvidia World Foundation Models](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/cosmos-world-foundation-models/)
- and many many others,

...provide LLMs with external simulations, application programming interfaces (APIs), data, and computation that doesn't have to be learned as part of the base model training or fine tuning. This allows for the LLM to access a much more diverse and rich set of data and ideas than it would otherwise have access to in it's training corpus. In fact, this idea of LLMs as a sort of "glue" for various tasks, data sets, and APIs form the foundational idea of Agentic AI. 

This approach however, has seen most of its success in domains that are readily computable such as access to APIs, physics simulations, or database queries. The very nature of "world models" is that their response can be calculated from physics models of the objects and agents in the virtual world. Another term for these are "Digital Twins" that simulate the behavior of a physical factory, smart city, or other physical system for example. I believe the reason for this rests in the fact that while they can be computationally expensive, we have really good mathematical models for many of these physical systems and thus they lend themselves to computation. This leads to my first conjecture about AIs and World Models: 

**Conjecture 1:** Large Language Models often excel at tasks where the accuracy of their output is relatively easy to verify. Testing whether code compiles, having a bilingual human verify a translation, determining if re-written prose sounds better, or a generated poem conforms to rhyme and meter, are all tasks that can be done by humans or verified computationally with relative ease. This makes reinforcement learning more tractable because we can plainly see (or test) if the output is correct.

However, there still exist a wide range of domains where it is more difficult, more subjective, and not as obvious to verify or test the correctness of an LLM output. It is not as easy, for example, to verify that a public policy recommendation is going to have the desired affect, or if a post on social media is going to foster civil discussion or cause harm, or if a particular social program is going to reach the desired people. These problems can't be "complied" as computer code can, these problems can sound coherent and well thought out, but then have secondary effects that are unintended. LLM generated public policy recommendations can be very detailed (especially with more and more detailed prompts as we will see below) and read very eloquently, however they will have been generated by "next token prediction" by a transformer network rather than generated by a simulation of, or contemplation and deliberation on, the outcome of the policy. Furthermore, if we can somehow make these foundations of society (law, policy, regulations, cultural text) more computable, we could auto generate massive amounts of training data to bake in this computable policy knowledge into the language models at training time. This could result in a future where our frontier AI models have computational knowledge of complex social, cultural, social, and civic domains. 

Therefore, the foundational motivation for this work is to answer the question:

***Can we make policy computable?***

# Prior Work

This idea of social, economic, policy, civic, and society simulation is not novel and there are many (many) examples where complex computational models have been used to guide public policy and decision making:

- *John Sterman* (2000). Business Dynamics: System Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World. New York: McGraw-Hill.
- *Stephen Wolfram (2016), [Computational Law, Symbolic Discourse and the AI Constitution](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/)
- *Edward J Walters* (2019). [Data Driven Law](https://www.routledge.com/Data-Driven-Law-Data-Analytics-and-the-New-Legal-Services/Walters/p/book/9781498766654)
- [MIT Computable Law Project](https://www.media.mit.edu/articles/a-perspective-on-legal-algorithms/)

...and of course many others. So this idea is not new, and in fact has been pontificated on by some computing and legal luminaries. I do think though, that as AIs in general and LLMs in particular continue to find use in more and more domains in our society, that highlighting the particular shortcomings of the frontier models for policy generation, and providing a philosophy on how we can remedy them through this approach is important. Through this work I also want to explore two particular avenues that I think are relatively novel and warrant further work: 

1) **Can an LLM be used to create the "world model" and then by running the model, learn knowledge it wouldn't otherwise have?** That is, does an LLM have the internal knowledge to (with clever prompting) create the computational world model, create configurations of specific runs of the model, and then learn from the output? This would hint at "weak-to-strong-***self*** generalization" as an adaptation of [Weak-to-Strong Generalization](https://openai.com/index/weak-to-strong-generalization/) if the LLM can create, and then learn from a computational world model. This **self** generalization may have alignment implications as we more fully explore agentic systems. 

2) **Can we use computational policy and LLMs to design policy or ideas around increasing AI equality in our society?** 2025 is turning out to be a pivotal year for public policy and AI technological development each individually, but this might be an especially important year for the intersection of these two domains. The adoption, distribution, and development of AI systems by different slices of society in the near term, might have feedback effects that entrench these early distributions of the technology for a long time to come. It might be especially important then to leverage these rapidly advancing technologies to design AI policy and regulation that most closely align with the values of freedom, equality, and democracy. 

# Methodology

In this paper, I will explore these three questions: 

1. Can we make policy computable?
2. Can an LLM generate its own world model for policy computation? and 
3. Can we use LLMs and this generated world model to explore or design policy to increase the adoption of AI tech and hence digital and AI literacy and equality?

To explore these questions, I will break my investigation into the following steps:

1. First I will explore current AI models (gpt4o, claude 3.5 haiku, and ollama3.1:8b) capability in designing a policy to increase the adoption of AI. I will examine the qualitative features of the models at progressively higher levels of detail in the policy. This initial method of model comparison is illustrated in the following figure:

![LLM Policy Generation]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/LLM_policy_generation_01.png)
*Figure 1: LLM Based Policy Generation and Iteration*

2. Next, I will also compare the model responses for different situations (AI education policy for two different municipalities) which I believe should cause substantive differences in the policy recommendations and outcomes. By comparing the different social situations, I will draw (again qualitative) comparisons between these. My hypothesis in this, is that while detailed and specific, there will be few differences between amongst the models for the same prompt, as well as few differences between the responses for the two municipalities. This method is illustrated below: 

![LLM Policy Generation]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/LLM_policy_generation_02.png)
*Figure 2: LLM Based Policy Generation for Specific Municipalities*

3. Next, I will explore using a single LLM to generate a policy world model to simulate AI adoption policy impacts. For this I will be using a rather simple toy model developed in [agentpy](https://agentpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Agentpy is a python module for simulating simple agent-based networks. I should note that these are not AI agents, but rather simple rules based agents. Even given this consideration, interesting and emergent behavior is often observed in models developed in agentpy. I will heavily leverage LLMs (specifically gpt4o and o1) in the creation of a progressively more complex agent based world model. This process is pictorially shown below.

![LLM generated world model]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/LLM_generated_world_model_01.png)
*Figure 3: LLM Generated World Model*

4. After the world model is built, I will leverage LLMs to generate the starting conditions and parameters of the agentpy simulation, as well as interpret the numeric results in a qualitative natural language way. My hypothesis for this step is that the LLM is capable of generating an agent based world model simulation, from which it can gain knowledge that it doesn't have in its base model. This step is illustrated below:

![New Knowledge]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/New_Knowledge.png)
*Figure 4: New Knowledge is potentially generated from the World Model interacting with the Language Model*


My hope is that through these steps I can demonstrate how LLMs can be used to not only generate rich world models for public policy recommendation and analysis, but also by using **AI tech adoption** as the exemplar policy in the above steps, develop some intuition about how we might adopt policy to increase that adoption. 

A quick disclaimer: I have only interest but no backround in public policy, or public tech policy. Furthermore, I will be exploring only toy models that are not fully descriptive of the complex dynamics, economics, and interactions in public policy analysis. Nevertheless, I think that this project serves as an interesting jumping off point for world model generation in this way, I if I can motivate the true public policy and social computing professionals to think about some of my proposed philosophy this will be a success. With that...*lets go!*

# Generating Public Policy with LLMs

In this first step I generated public policy recommendations at different levels of detail and evaluated the results for their qualitative strengths and weaknesses, as well as differences and similarities between models. As stated above, the paper will use as a use case, public policy to increase AI tech adoption across different cross sections of society.

<details>
    <summary>
    Click here for full text of response
    </summary>


### **Why Focus on Education, Awareness, and Workforce Readiness?**
1. **Breaking Barriers to Adoption:**
   - Many people and organizations hesitate to adopt AI because they don’t understand it, feel intimidated, or perceive it as a threat to jobs.
   - By demystifying AI and building widespread AI literacy, individuals and organizations are more likely to adopt the technology.

2. **Empowering Workers and Businesses:**
   - Without a workforce equipped to use AI, even the most advanced technologies will remain underutilized.
   - Upskilling workers and supporting SMEs to integrate AI ensures broad economic participation and reduces fears of automation-driven unemployment.

3. **Creating Trust and Social Buy-In:**
   - A lack of trust in AI systems is a key adoption barrier. Public education campaigns that show tangible benefits of AI and address concerns (e.g., job displacement, privacy) build public confidence.

4. **Expanding the Talent Pool:**
   - Making AI education accessible increases the number of people who can develop, implement, and manage AI systems, ensuring a sustained pipeline of talent for economic growth.

---

### **Key Actions to Prioritize:**

#### **1. National AI Literacy Programs**
   - Launch free or low-cost online and offline AI training for all ages, from basic AI concepts to advanced technical skills.
   - Partner with tech companies and universities to create tailored content for diverse groups (e.g., students, business leaders, workers in at-risk industries).

#### **2. Upskilling the Workforce**
   - Provide government-funded, industry-aligned AI reskilling programs for workers in automation-prone sectors.
   - Offer incentives for businesses to retrain employees instead of replacing them with AI.

#### **3. AI Awareness Campaigns**
   - Run large-scale, engaging public campaigns showcasing real-world examples of AI improving lives (e.g., healthcare innovations, safer transportation, personalized education).
   - Emphasize how AI creates new job opportunities and reduces repetitive, mundane work.

#### **4. Support for Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs**
   - Launch "AI Starter Kits" for SMEs, including easy-to-use tools, training, and access to consultants, helping them integrate AI without requiring advanced technical expertise.
   - Subsidize AI implementation costs for small businesses to lower the financial barrier.

#### **5. Early AI Education**
   - Embed AI concepts into primary and secondary school curricula to prepare future generations.
   - Promote AI clubs, hackathons, and competitions for young learners to build interest and skills early.

---

### **Expected Results of This Focus:**

I would say that the prompts at this high level were fairly diverse. While they did have several similarities, each model had unique atributes that the others did not. This shouldn't be entirely surprising as even the same model with the same prompt can (and often do) give varying responses. This highlights one of the strengths of LLMs: to provide a jumping off point for further investigation. Lets go one level deeper; all of the models emphasized AI upskilling and education, lets dive into that.

Again there were some pretty strong similarities:
1. AI literacy and education across all ages, K-12, University, and Adult
2. A focus on reaching underserved groups and communities
3. Upskilling in the workplace as well as in school
4. Practical, hands on education
5. Addressing alignment, ethical, and social education

And some marked differences:
1. ChatGPT-4o provided much more detail including specific curriculum elements, specific workforce sectors (which is intresting as it did not mention specific sectors in the high level prompt), and highlights grass roots efforts
2. Llama3.1 mentions a direct integration of AI ethics into the curriculum rather than a standalone element.
3. Claude 3.5 was rather brief with its response - This may have been due to the fact that the time of day of my inquiry was a high demand time and I did get a message that the responses would be made brief.

Again, the responses at this level were similar in some respects, however each one emphasized a different aspect of the policy. As an interesting aside, I wonder if in an agentic system that leverages several diverse LLMs to produce responses to a fairly complex prompt (like these), if the similarities can be viewed as a sort of voting mechanism to elicit the high level ideas that are the biggest priority. For example, if all three mention education and specifically life long education, maybe that can be used as an indication of where to expend resources. *Perhaps the topic of another paper*
