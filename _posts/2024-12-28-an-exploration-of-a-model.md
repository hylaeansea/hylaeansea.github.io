## A Refinement of the Idea

The germ of the idea was computational policy; policy, regulations, social norms, rules, principles, that are by default implemented as natural language and encoded as such. These filaments of language make up the bounding shapes of how our society functions, what is possible, what is not, and a means to shape that. These rules are in some cases as hard and fast as the rules of physics, or chemistry, or biology in the way that they can affect our everyday lives. Several papers and highly successful (read Nobel Prize winning) applications of teaching neural networks about the physical sciences have been well documented in the literature. These neural networks are trained to control the configurations of physical systems and then simulations are run, or in some cases the neural network is the simulation 



look at MESA for models in python

look at simple agentpy models

Look at netlogo

This is the exploration of the types of models I want to explore in this project. First a warning, the word model is going to get overloaded quickly in this project and I need a way to distinguish between the Large Language **Model** (or a generic AI **Model** for that matter) and the physics and mathematics **Model** that we will be interfacing the LLMs with. I think I will use the term "Language Model" to mean the AI or LLM generating the policy and simulation conditions, and the term "World Model" to mean the physics, math, social, agent, or complex system model that we will be trying to learn from.
