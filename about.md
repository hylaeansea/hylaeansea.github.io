This is the home for a series of ongoing experiments in AI alignment, science communication, simulations, public policy, conservation and ecology. Our fundamental goal is to bridge the gap between our cutting edge AIs in the form of Large Language Models, and bring them to bear on our most pressing social, environmental, and societal problems. We are exploring the bounds of the question:
***what can be made computable?***
